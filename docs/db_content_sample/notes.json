  "description": "Introduce the brawler -Brock aka. Monkey",
  "contentMD": "![images.jfif](http://note.garychen.top:3000/static/note-pic/b741579c304bd889eebddae01.jfif)\n## Basic info\n\"Brock fires a long-range, explosive rocket at enemies. His Super is a ballistic rocket barrage that destroys cover!\"\nBrock is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 1000 Trophies. He has low health but a high damage output. His attack shoots long-ranged rockets that explode and deal area damage in a short radius. His Super fires a barrage of rockets in a large area. His first Gadget, Rocket Laces, allows him to fire at his feet, damaging nearby enemies and knock them back, and launching Brock into the air. His second Gadget, Rocket Fuel, makes Brock's next attack a mega rocket that has a larger explosion radius, destroys walls and travels faster. His first Star Power, More Rockets!, increases the number of rockets fired from his Super. His second Star Power, Rocket No. Four, increases Brock's ammo capacity to 4.\n\n## Tips\n* Try to predict where opponents are going to be. His rockets are fairly slow and narrow, and the enemies will likely be moving.\nBrock performs the best in open maps that don't have a lot of cover so that close-ranged Brawlers couldn't ambush him.\nAlways keep Brock behind other teammates, because he has fairly low health and is best used for long-ranged support instead.\nIn Duo Showdown, two Brawlers will most likely be near each other, and Brock's rockets have a small area of explosion when it hits something or when the rocket's range distance ends. Shooting a rocket in between the two Brawlers when they're near will damage both of them greatly. Since his attack's splash radius is also large enough to go through walls slightly, use it to damage enemies extremely close to walls, similarly to Jacky's attack.\n* Because of Brock's very slow reload time, it's important to make every shot count. Don't fire off all three rockets at once, since that will leave Brock completely defenseless. While his Rocket No. Four Star Power give Brock one additional ammo, it is still worthwhile to maintain your ammo for when you need it.\nUse Brock's Super whenever the opponents group up or one is hiding behind a wall.\n* When using Brock's Super against an enemy, make it count and try to aim it perfectly, as sometimes some Brawlers can escape and deal damage to you when you are still in the duration of the Super.\n* Brock's Super is great for getting the enemy team to split up as they avoid the rockets so that teammates can deal with them individually.\n* Brock's Rocket Laces Gadget can be used for briefly getting away from ambushing assassins or tanks. He can also use it to keep distance by jumping over walls or to get close to throwers behind walls.\n* At close range, Brock can easily defeat lower-health Brawlers by quick-firing 3 rockets. Saving Brock's ammunition and using his Gadget Rocket Laces is especially useful for close-range ambushes.\n* Brock isn’t a viable Brawler to use in Special Events because he has slow reload speed and his Super can break walls, giving the robots a huge advantage in Robo Rumble and Boss Fight, and helping the Mega Monster destroy the city in Super City Rampage.\n* Use him in Heist to break the walls covering the enemy safe so that he can land burst damage on the enemy safe easily. Also, with his long range, he can deal massive damage to the safe while staying relatively safe from a safe distance as well. His attack's slow projectile speed will not be a disadvantage as the safe is stationary, but enemies might have time to go to the safe and tank some of the shots.\n* Brock's Super can be used against a wall in front of a goal in Brawl Ball, meaning Brock does not have to go around the wall. He can also use his Rocket Fuel Gadget to break the walls. This applies to all Brawl Ball maps with a wall in front of the goal.\nBrock's Rocket Fuel Gadget aids in Brock's area denial. Brock can deal splash damage, but it is rather difficult unless enemies stay within one tile. Making each individual shot count is vital for Brock whose slow reload speed and projectile speed makes him vulnerable once a couple of shots are fired. It also allows Brock to open up walls on the map without having to charge his Super first.\n* Brock can use Rocket Fuel to break open important walls on the map without needing to charge his Super - a very important tool in maps such as Backyard Bowl or Shooting Star. He can use his Gadget at the start of the match to give his team a huge defensive advantage. One advantage over his Super is that you can better predict the amount of walls Brock's Gadget will destroy as opposed to his Super, which only shows the area-of effect of possible missile hits which is harder to control. However, unlike his super, this shot can be body-blocked by enemies or spawnables (such as the shadows from Tara's Support from Beyond), as the attack does not pierce. However, if your target is standing near their spawnables, the small explosion radius ensures they will still get damaged.\n* Brock is a strong Brawler in certain maps in Siege. Paired with his Rocket Fuel Gadget and Incendiary Star Power, he can consistently damage the IKE. Brock can move on the side of the enemies' spawn area (just beyond the IKE's reach), and with Brock's moderately fast unload speed, he is able to hit all three shots onto the IKE, dealing massive damage, and with his Rocket Fuel Gadget, he can deal additional damage to the Siege bot or the IKE turret.",

  "contentMD": "![images.jfif](http://note.garychen.top:3000/static/note-pic/b741579c304bd889eebddae01.jfif)\n## Basic info\n\"Brock fires a long-range, explosive rocket at enemies. His Super is a ballistic rocket barrage that destroys cover!\"\nBrock is a Common Brawler who is unlocked as a Trophy Road reward upon reaching 1000 Trophies. He has low health but a high damage output. His attack shoots long-ranged rockets that explode and deal area damage in a short radius. His Super fires a barrage of rockets in a large area. His first Gadget, Rocket Laces, allows him to fire at his feet, damaging nearby enemies and knock them back, and launching Brock into the air. His second Gadget, Rocket Fuel, makes Brock's next attack a mega rocket that has a larger explosion radius, destroys walls and travels faster. His first Star Power, More Rockets!, increases the number of rockets fired from his Super. His second Star Power, Rocket No. Four, increases Brock's ammo capacity to 4.\n\n## Tips\n* Try to predict where opponents are going to be. His rockets are fairly slow and narrow, and the enemies will likely be moving.\nBrock performs the best in open maps that don't have a lot of cover so that close-ranged Brawlers couldn't ambush him.\nAlways keep Brock behind other teammates, because he has fairly low health and is best used for long-ranged support instead.\nIn Duo Showdown, two Brawlers will most likely be near each other, and Brock's rockets have a small area of explosion when it hits something or when the rocket's range distance ends. Shooting a rocket in between the two Brawlers when they're near will damage both of them greatly. Since his attack's splash radius is also large enough to go through walls slightly, use it to damage enemies extremely close to walls, similarly to Jacky's attack.\n* Because of Brock's very slow reload time, it's important to make every shot count. Don't fire off all three rockets at once, since that will leave Brock completely defenseless. While his Rocket No. Four Star Power give Brock one additional ammo, it is still worthwhile to maintain your ammo for when you need it.\nUse Brock's Super whenever the opponents group up or one is hiding behind a wall.\n* When using Brock's Super against an enemy, make it count and try to aim it perfectly, as sometimes some Brawlers can escape and deal damage to you when you are still in the duration of the Super.\n* Brock's Super is great for getting the enemy team to split up as they avoid the rockets so that teammates can deal with them individually.\n* Brock's Rocket Laces Gadget can be used for briefly getting away from ambushing assassins or tanks. He can also use it to keep distance by jumping over walls or to get close to throwers behind walls.\n* At close range, Brock can easily defeat lower-health Brawlers by quick-firing 3 rockets. Saving Brock's ammunition and using his Gadget Rocket Laces is especially useful for close-range ambushes.\n* Brock isn’t a viable Brawler to use in Special Events because he has slow reload speed and his Super can break walls, giving the robots a huge advantage in Robo Rumble and Boss Fight, and helping the Mega Monster destroy the city in Super City Rampage.\n* Use him in Heist to break the walls covering the enemy safe so that he can land burst damage on the enemy safe easily. Also, with his long range, he can deal massive damage to the safe while staying relatively safe from a safe distance as well. His attack's slow projectile speed will not be a disadvantage as the safe is stationary, but enemies might have time to go to the safe and tank some of the shots.\n* Brock's Super can be used against a wall in front of a goal in Brawl Ball, meaning Brock does not have to go around the wall. He can also use his Rocket Fuel Gadget to break the walls. This applies to all Brawl Ball maps with a wall in front of the goal.\nBrock's Rocket Fuel Gadget aids in Brock's area denial. Brock can deal splash damage, but it is rather difficult unless enemies stay within one tile. Making each individual shot count is vital for Brock whose slow reload speed and projectile speed makes him vulnerable once a couple of shots are fired. It also allows Brock to open up walls on the map without having to charge his Super first.\n* Brock can use Rocket Fuel to break open important walls on the map without needing to charge his Super - a very important tool in maps such as Backyard Bowl or Shooting Star. He can use his Gadget at the start of the match to give his team a huge defensive advantage. One advantage over his Super is that you can better predict the amount of walls Brock's Gadget will destroy as opposed to his Super, which only shows the area-of effect of possible missile hits which is harder to control. However, unlike his super, this shot can be body-blocked by enemies or spawnables (such as the shadows from Tara's Support from Beyond), as the attack does not pierce. However, if your target is standing near their spawnables, the small explosion radius ensures they will still get damaged.\n* Brock is a strong Brawler in certain maps in Siege. Paired with his Rocket Fuel Gadget and Incendiary Star Power, he can consistently damage the IKE. Brock can move on the side of the enemies' spawn area (just beyond the IKE's reach), and with Brock's moderately fast unload speed, he is able to hit all three shots onto the IKE, dealing massive damage, and with his Rocket Fuel Gadget, he can deal additional damage to the Siege bot or the IKE turret.",

  "contentMD": "==Animal Crossing== is a social simulation video game series developed and published by ++Nintendo++. The series was conceptualized and created by Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami. In Animal Crossing, the player character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is notable for its open-ended gameplay and use of the video game console's internal clock and calendar to simulate the real passage of time. :laughing: :laughing: :laughing:\n![u=2031255258,3368505111fm=253fmt=autoapp=138f=JPEG.png](http://note.garychen.top:3000/static/note-pic/b2b62090e6ca0e2b225ad8105.png)\nSince its initial release in 2001, five Animal Crossing games have been released worldwide, one each for the Nintendo 64/iQue Player (enhanced and reissued for the GameCube), Nintendo DS, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Nintendo Switch. The series has been both critically and commercially successful and has sold over 60 million units worldwide. \nit is my note!!",
